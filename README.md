# SpinePs4Linux
Spine is a compatibility layer developed for Linux that allows PlayStation 4 games to work. The project is largely developed in private by a single developer, spinedev. Spine's first public demo was the first to launch commercial games. More builds have since been released which supports many more commercial titles.
